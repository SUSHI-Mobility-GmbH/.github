## Who We Are

At SUSHI Bikes, we're not just a bike company; we're a movement. Born out of a passion for sustainable urban mobility, we aim to redefine the way people commute in cities. Our bikes are a blend of aesthetics, affordability, and functionality, designed keeping the modern urban rider in mind.

## Why We Do This

In an age of congested cities and environmental concerns, we see bikes as more than just a mode of transport. They're a solution. A way to declutter roads, reduce carbon footprints, and promote a healthier lifestyle. Through SUSHI Bikes, we aim to make this vision a reality, one ride at a time.
